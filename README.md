# Social-research project
In this project I analyze the Immigration and Emigration of Foreign Citizens to and from Italy in the period 1995-2013.
I used a lot the Plotly library for creating interesting plots (pies, bars and maps)

The dataset 'italy.xlsx' is an Excel file, the source is the UN website.

After the EDA and the plotting, I tried to predict the future 3 years immigration and emigration rates of foreign citizens in Italy, using both polynomial and linear regression, and ARIMA, an interesting machine learning tool to predic future data using the historical data available.

The results are satisfactory, since they are really close to the real values present in the ISTAT reports.

I also made a Social Report that explains the main elements of the analysis, with the socio-cultural events that characterized the Emigration and Immigration of foreign citizens from and to Italy. 
At the end of the Report ("Immigration and Emigration in Italy 1995"), it is possible to check the accuracy and consistency of the ARIMA previsions.
